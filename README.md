# 2d_particle_sim
A 2D particle simulator created using matplotlib animate to be connected to OpenWSN or similar network simulator to test micro-robot control functions and algorithms. Run sim_v2.py. (Note: simulator_v1.py was a pygame implementation that is now discontinued / no longer functional.)

# TODO:
1. connect to https://bitbucket.org/6tisch/simulator to send commands to change velocity and stuff
2. Fine tune coefficients and clip values (current values are tested to be stable up to at least 15 drones)
3. Add lines between drone points (like in simulator_v1)
